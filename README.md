ReviewGuard – Fake Review Detection System

Project Overview
ReviewGuard is an end-to-end **Machine Learning and NLP-based system** designed to classify product reviews as **fake or genuine**.  
The project covers the complete ML lifecycle—from data preprocessing and model training to prediction and application-level usage—following **industry-standard project structuring and practices**.

---

## Problem Statement
Online platforms rely heavily on user reviews for decision-making. However, **fake and manipulated reviews** distort credibility, mislead customers, and harm fair competition.  
Manual moderation does not scale, making **automated ML-based detection** essential.

---

## Why Fake Review Detection Matters
- Maintains trust on e-commerce platforms  
- Protects consumers from misleading information  
- Prevents reputation manipulation  
- Supports compliance with transparency regulations  

Scalable ML-based systems enable efficient moderation at scale.

## Data Description
- **Dataset:** `train_reviews.csv`
- **Type:** Supervised learning dataset
- **Labels:**
  - `0` → Genuine review
  - `1` → Fake review
- Contains review text and associated metadata used for training.

---

## Data Preprocessing Steps
- Text lowercasing
- Removal of punctuation and special characters
- Tokenization
- Stop-word removal
- Text normalization
- Conversion to numerical features

These steps reduce noise and improve classification performance.

---

## Model & Algorithm Explanation
The system uses **classical supervised ML classifiers** (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes) trained on NLP-derived features.  
This approach provides a strong balance between **interpretability, efficiency, and accuracy**, making it suitable for real-world deployment scenarios.

````

Implemented in `train_model.py`.

---

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy** – Overall correctness
- **Precision** – Reliability of fake predictions
- **Recall** – Ability to detect fake reviews
- **F1-score** – Balance between precision and recall

These metrics ensure robust and unbiased evaluation.
