# ReviewGuard – Fake Review Detection System

## Project Overview

ReviewGuard is an end-to-end **Machine Learning and NLP-based system** designed to classify product reviews as **fake or genuine**. The project implements the complete ML lifecycle—from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and application-level prediction—following **industry-standard project structure and practices**.

---

## Problem Statement

Online platforms rely heavily on user reviews for decision-making. However, **fake and manipulated reviews** distort credibility, mislead customers, and negatively impact fair competition. Manual moderation does not scale, making **automated ML-based detection** a critical requirement.

---

## Why Fake Review Detection Matters

* Maintains trust and transparency on e-commerce platforms
* Protects consumers from misleading information
* Prevents reputation manipulation and unfair market influence
* Supports regulatory and platform-level compliance

Scalable ML-based solutions enable reliable moderation at scale.

## Data Description

* **Dataset:** `train_reviews.csv`
* **Type:** Supervised learning dataset
* **Labels:**

  * `0` → Genuine review
  * `1` → Fake review
* Contains review text and relevant metadata used for model training and evaluation.

---

## Data Preprocessing Steps

* Text lowercasing
* Removal of punctuation and special characters
* Tokenization
* Stop-word removal
* Text normalization
* Conversion to numerical feature vectors

These steps reduce noise and improve model generalization.

---

## Model & Algorithm Explanation

The system employs **classical supervised machine learning classifiers** (e.g., Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) trained on NLP-derived features. This design choice ensures a strong balance between **interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive performance**, making it suitable for real-world deployment and analysis.

---

## Training Pipeline

```
Load Dataset
 → Preprocess Text
 → Feature Engineering
 → Train Model
 → Evaluate Metrics (on held-out test set)
 → Save Trained Model
```

The training workflow is implemented in `train_model.py`.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated on a **held-out test set** using:

* **Accuracy** – Overall classification correctness
* **Precision** – Reliability of fake review predictions
* **Recall** – Ability to correctly identify fake reviews
* **F1-score** – Balance between precision and recall

These metrics provide a balanced and unbiased evaluation of model performance.
